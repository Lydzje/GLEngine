# GLEngine
GLEngine is an OpenGL game engine that I started working on in summer of 2017. It 
gonna be open source and free of course, I've put the © symbol while I'm looking for the 
appropiate license.
<br>
<br>

### Nice name
GLEngine is not its definitive name, I'll think on it later when it is possible to do 
something playable with it.
<br>
<br>

### Planning
I intend to get it working with 2D for now. I'll try to do some kind of map editor so it's
easy to create levels and that stuff.
<br>
<br>

### Setup
GLEngine uses some libraries as GLFW to work. I'll list them later, as well as all things you 
have to do to get it working. I have to investigate how to make a project like this one portable 
over all platforms (I have zero idea...).

### Some comments
Everything may look messy sorry, I'll do my best to improve it and keep it clean, just don't try 
to use it for now.
